[Intro]
Em7 G   Dsus4   A7sus4   Em7 G   Dsus4   A7sus4
 
[Verse 1]
Em7      G
Today is gonna be the day
             Dsus4                  A7sus4
That they're gonna throw it back to you,
Em7        G
By now you should of somehow
   Dsus4                A7sus4
Realised what you gotta do.
Em7                  G       Dsus4           A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Cadd9 Dsus4   A7sus4
About you now.
 
[Verse 2]
Em7            G
Back beat, the word is on the street
         Dsus4                 A7sus4
That the fire in your heart is out,
Em7             G
I'm sure you've heard it all before,
        Dsus4              A7sus4
But you never really had a doubt.
Em7                  G       Dsus4           A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Em7 G   Dsus4 A7sus4
About you now.
 
[Bridge]
    C                D                Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
    C                   D                 Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding,
C              D                   G       G/F#   Em7
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      G          A7sus4
But I don't know how.
 
[Chorus]
        Cadd9  Em7   G
Because maybe,
       Em7                   Cadd9     Em7 G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em7   Cadd9  Em7   G
And after all,
          Em7   Cadd9   Em7   G   Em7
You're my wonderwall.
 
[Verse 3]
Em7       G
Today was gonna be the day,
            Dsus4                  A7sus4
But they'll never throw it back to you,
Em7        G
By now you should have somehow
   Dsus4                    A7sus4
Realised what you're not to do.
Em7                  G       Dsus4           A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Em7  G     Dsus4 A7sus4
About you now.
 
[Bridge 2]
    C                   D                 Em
And all the roads that lead you there are winding,
    C                   D                 Em
And all the lights that light the way are blinding,
C              D                   G       G/F#   Em7
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      G          A7sus4
But I don't know how.
 
[Chorus 2]
        Cadd9  Em7   G
I said maybe,
       Em7                   Cadd9     Em7   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em7   Cadd9  Em7   G
And after all,
          Em7   Cadd9  Em7   G Em7
You're my wonderwall.
 
[Chorus 3]
        Cadd9  Em7   G
I said maybe,
       Em7                   Cadd9     Em7   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em7   Cadd9  Em7   G
And after all,
          Em7   Cadd9  Em7   G Em7
You're my wonderwall.
 
[Outro]
        Cadd9  Em7   G
I said maybe,
       Em7                   Cadd9     Em7   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       Em7                   Cadd9     Em7   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       Em7                   Cadd9     Em7   G Em7
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
